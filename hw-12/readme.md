This week was a lot of fun and a great way to wrap up. With this assignment I was able to combine code from previous works to create something fun and hopefully visually interesting! I was able to create a few different functions that would interact with my Eyes piece from week 11. I actually started this assignment from week 11's code and built from there. I was able to find a few different interesting ways to make objects interact but I found that keeping it simple was more visually pleasing. So, I decided to just do a simple bounds for the eyes so they would only move in a designated area of my interest. It took a minute to figure out how to do, but once i had the knowledge it was easy. I wish to add some other functions to make it interactive but didn't seem to find the time this week. Overall I am pleased and hope you find my work interesting!
