# *Progress*
This week I forgot to do the assignment before break :(. I sat down to do it today thinking it'll be due mid week then I remembered that the shedule was changed due to the break, and what do you know it was due today at 8am. So I made my way through the lesson, It seemed farily easy and simple. I just had to restucture some code and turn it into an array and as you can see I did just that. I took the "eye" coding I've used for hw and turned it into oop programming. It turned out pretty well and I learned alot. This makes things easier to manipulate, build upon, and search through. I am still getting use to Arrays and the use of them, I have the general sense but I still seem to get tripped up here and there. Overall I am feeling very well about the class and my progession. My code consists of the eyes and an array of them moving around the screen without leaving(bounce off walls). Enjoy!
