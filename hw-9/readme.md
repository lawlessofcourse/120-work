# Hw-9 Readme

# *Progress and Issues*
This section of homework seemed a litte more intimidating and harder to understand. I had some troubles coming to understand arrays and how they work. After reviewing the lesson and watching Shiffman videos on Youtube, I got the hang of it. For my HW I basically followed along with the Shiffman videos on Arrays. After following along I altered the code to make it my own. I wanted to add in more and possibly change my whole code. I seemed to run out of time to create my intentions. I'm still working on it and am close. But this Hw was fun to learn and brought back a lot of rough memories learning Arrays in C++, but make sense to me more now then they ever did! As long as i practice with arrays I will learn how to use them more effieciently. That goes along with using functions. I have the hang of functions but sometimes the organization confuses me. I try to make it so that my function can be in its most simple form when called in draw(). Other than that I had fun learning how to use arrays and functions, I'm very interested what else arrays can bring to the table.
