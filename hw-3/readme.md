# Hw- 3 Readme

["Hello World!" Sketch](https://lawlessofcourse.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

*Week 3 Summary:*
*In week 3 of creative coding we were introduced to p5.js. We learned about some basic functions, what they do and how they work. As you can see from hw-3(or the url link above) I have created a canvas, background, and text. They are all simple and basic ideas within p5.js but are also a base on where coding for us starts. As I worked through the course this week, I payed particular attention to the code we learned. While doing so, I tried to take notes and think about what other possible uses the function could have.

*This week I came across one issue. The only issue I seem to have had was launching Atom. I posted about it in the issues section on our GitHub course page. I can get it to launch but only through Git Bash. More details are in the post. I have not recieved feedback as of now and I know there has been past issues with launching Atom. For now I can use Git Bash and the command atom .(repository name) to open any repositories that I desire.

*We learned a lot of interesting things this week. I am very interested in learning more coding. This lesson was basic and intended to introduce us to the coding world of p5. But, I am excited to see what else we can create, how it can be done, and even more so how it can be manipulated. Everything mentioned and focused on in this lesson was described thoroughly. Only leaving me with anticipation on what comes next. 

*While looking through the issues on the course git hub repository, I saw that someone had troubles using Powershell. I suggested a switch over to Git Bash. I did so because I found that Git Bash is much easier to follow along with while working on the lesson. Also, all the commands I've come across in the lesson (that were used on Unix) work in Git Bash. A lot of Powershell commands work also.
