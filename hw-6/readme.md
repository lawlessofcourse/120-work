# HW-6

# *Progress*
This week was a little more difficult and time consuming. Although all this brings me back to C++ coding I had to relearn it. But, this weeks lesson made that easy. I went through the lesson as usual, going page by page and playing with the new ideas. When it came to doing the homework I wasn't sure where to start. So I decided to start with a simple animation that included some of the ideas in the assignment. From there I built off of it, adding to it layer by layer, funciton by function, algorithm by algorithm. From this idea I aimed to create something visually interesting and met the assignments criteria.

# *Issues*
Most of the problems I had during the assignment was figuring out what I wanted my sketch to do. I ran into some debugging errors throughout, so I went back and referenced the lesson and other resources. I also had a hard time following the code in the example. Mainly, I had trouble understanding all the alogorithms and how they worked together. Also, I was wondering if there was a way to set two things in motion with one tracing(background in setup) and the other an animation without tracing(background in draw()) Other than that, I had no major issues. 



# *Interests*
I'm going to work on creating more algorithms and working with math and how it affects code. I would like to be more fluent in creating math equations to manipulate the code. Also, I am interested in learning loops. How they work and what they do.
