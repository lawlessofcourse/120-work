# Hw-4 Readme

# *Progress*
This week we had a chance to get creative and draw a self portrait or a monster. After going through the lesson and reading the chapters in the *Getting started with p5.js* I felt confident in doing the assignment. I drew a sketch and set up my skeleton for the code. I decided to draw a monster, more specifically a dragon. I started with objects/shapes that would reside in the back of the image and worked my way forward making sure to use push and pop whenever transformations were necessarry. I played with different shapes, transformations, the use of various packages and more.

# *Issues*
During the assignment I ran into a few issues. They tended to be syntax errors. I was very good about correcting the code and checking the image everytime I made adjustments. I had a hard time of thinking of a way to make a tail that was curvy. I had a few ideas but required a lot of shapes and transformations, I didnt have the time to make it. Other than that I felt like I had a grip on the subject and was able to make it through. I saw that there was not many issues posted in the Issues forum on the classroom github page. The ones that were there were answered.

# *Interests*
After this week I would like to know how to make duplicates in a simpler manner than copying and pasting 5 lines at a time. I'm also interested in what other functions there are that would be of use. I am excited to learn more ways to manipulate objects via code.

Well here is my sketch from this week!
