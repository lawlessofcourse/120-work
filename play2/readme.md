# *Week Summary*
This week I went through the lessons material and realized that I have been doing loops correctly. Also I found some code from earlier that used loops. So, I took that code, made it look pretty, and edited the loop so it made more sense to the viewer. This week was simple and easy. Thanks for the break!
