# Hw- 5 Readme

# *Progress*
This week we learned how to set things in motion using self created variables and simple math. This is where coding gets familiar to me. In C++ programming this was the basis of our work We would create functions and use them as math variables to create a program. This was much more enjoyable since I got to use these methods with shapes. I had fun experiementing with new shapes, designs, and motions. This weeek I went through the lessons work and started brainstorming ideas. Mainly, I just found new things to experiment with and went from there.

# *Issues*
There was a lot of playing with the code and seeing what it yields this week. I had trouble at first creating loops(even though we are not there yet). I wanted to create expanding circles that never stop. I found that i could create x amount of circles that are all spaced evenly but if set in motion, they would move off the screen and never be seen again. So in combination with an if statement I was able to successfully create what I was after. But, as I went on I played with new ideas that were more concrete to me. I did not post my issues on github because I was having issues with the loops mainly, and the class isn't there yet. After a lot of practice I now know how to create for loops correctly.

# *Interests*
I am really excited to see what other manipulations we can apply to create a new affect in coding. I would like to see loops explained and am very interested in using shapes and animation to create visuals. I got far with the expanding circles code but decided to save it for later. I have submitted code that has a rocket and uses similar coding to create the ellipse that are the exhaust from the rocket. Enjoy!
